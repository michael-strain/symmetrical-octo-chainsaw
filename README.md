This is mine.  You can't have any.

That being said, when this is complete, I'll probably try to throw up all over steam with it, so like, five bucks and it's yours.




The game itself is about love, death, loss, tragedy, comedy, excitement, adventure, trailing lists of adjectives,
but mostly just shooting stuff.  
My image of the game is sort of like a really dirty, semi-violent threesome between Asteroids, Tron, and Diablo.
If you want to actually contribute to this game, send me an e-mail and I would be happy to send you some tasks,
but you likely have much better things to do with your life... so quit procrastinating and go do them.
